  1: The code is not following the best practices on space and indentation. See the official Go documentation, and look at `fmt` sub-command in `go` executable.
  4: We found some unnecessary type casting (casting from a type to the same type), e.g.: `var x int` and `p = int(x)`
  1: Check all variable assignments. Some variables receive a value but then you don't use them, or you overwrite them before using the value.
 24: Some APIs endpoints have been defined in the OpenAPI document, but the implementation is missing.
